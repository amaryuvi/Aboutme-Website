                <p>I had been following Michael’s (and many others’) sites fairly closely for a year when Michael wrote this post detailing his “overnight” success.</p>
                <p>
                    In the post, Michael walks through all the different businesses he dabbled in before he ever started IncomeDiary. Michael ran sites for 4 or 5 years before he even started IncomeDiary in 2008.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By this time, I had my own site and I was struggling to get even a couple thousand people a month to it. It was refreshing to read about all the hard lessons Michael learned along the way and to realize that there’s no such thing as overnight success.
